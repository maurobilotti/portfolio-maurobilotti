        Hello! I'm Mauro, an information systems engineer based in Buenos Aires,
        Argentina.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be
        websites, applications, or anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to always build products with high quality from the OOP
        design or even the <i class="fas fa-users"></i> user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have +10 years of experience as a full-stack programmer mostly around
        Microsoft .NET technologies. I recently finished my engineering career
        in the <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>
        <a href="https://www.frba.utn.edu.ar/en/"
          >Universidad Tecnologica Nacional (UTN).</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a <i class="fas fa-music"></i> music and
        <i class="fas fa-futbol"></i> sports lover, and recently I started to be
        really interested on crypto-based currencies like
        <i class="fab fa-bitcoin"></i> Bitcoin.
